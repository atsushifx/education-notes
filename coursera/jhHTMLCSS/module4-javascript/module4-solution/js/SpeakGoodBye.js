// NOTE! The steps in this file are basically identical to the ones you
// performed in the SpeakHello.js file.

// STEP 6: Wrap the entire contents of SpeakGoodBye.js inside of an IIFE
// See Lecture 52, part 2


// STEP 7: Create an object, called 'byeSpeaker' to which you will attach
// the "speak" method and which you will expose to the global context
// See Lecture 52, part 1
// var byeSpeaker =

let byeSpeaker = (function () {
  let f = {}
  // DO NOT attach the speakWord variable to the 'byeSpeaker' object.
  f.speakWord = "Good Bye";

  // STEP 8: Rewrite the 'speak' function such that it is attached to the
  // byeSpeaker object instead of being a standalone function.
  // See Lecture 52, part 2
  f.speak = function (name) {
    console.log(f.speakWord + " " + name);
  }

  // STEP 9: Expose the 'byeSpeaker' object to the global scope. Name it
  // 'byeSpeaker' on the global scope as well.
  // xxxx.xxxx = byeSpeaker;
  return f;
})()
