# The World Wide Web Project

## Context
The son of computer scientists, Berners-Lee was born in London in 1955 (the same year as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates) and studied physics at Oxford. While employed at CERN in the 1980s, Berners-Lee observed how tough it was to keep track of the projects and computer systems of the organization’s thousands of researchers, who were spread around the globe. As he later stated: "In those days, there was different information on different computers, but you had to log on to different computers to get at it. Also, sometimes you had to learn a different program on each computer."

In March 1989, Berners-Lee gave managers at CERN a proposal for an information management system that used hypertext to link documents on different computers that were connected to the Internet. (Hypertext, a term coined in 1963, allows a person to get a document or piece of content by clicking on a coded word or phrase.) Labelled “vague but exciting” by his boss, the proposal at first wasn’t accepted. Berners-Lee teamed up with Robert Cailliau, a Belgian engineer at CERN, to refine the proposal, and in 1990 the Englishman’s boss gave him time to work on the project. After originally calling the project Information Management, Berners-Lee tried out names such as Mine of Information and Information Mesh before settling on WorldWideWeb.

By the end of 1990, Berners-Lee, using a Steve Jobs-designed NeXT computer, had developed the key technologies that are the bedrock of the Web, including Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), for creating Web pages; Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a set of rules for transferring data across the Web; and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), or Web addresses for finding a document or page. He also had devised a basic browser and Web server software.

The beginning of the Web as a publicly available service on the Internet arrived on August 6, 1991, when Berners-Lee published the first-ever website. Fittingly, the site was about the World Wide Web project, describing the Web and how to use it. Hosted at CERN on Berners-Lee’s NeXT computer.

## Problem Statement
Replicate the World's First Web Site as shared in the [PDF](./The-World-Wide-Web-Project.pdf).

## Instructions

1. Download and unzip the boilerplate code.
2. Run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies required for automated testing.
3. Open the boilerplate code in VSCode to develop the assignment solution.
4. Add required code in the `index.html` file
5. First, test the solution locally by running the command `npm run test`.
6. Refactor the solution to ensure all test cases are passing.
7. DO NOT MODIFY THE PROVIDED CODE, ELSE THIS MAY IMPACT THE TEST CODE EXECUTION.
8. Zip the solution code by selecting all the files and folders **excluding** the `node_modules` folder and give the name same as assignment name to the zipped file.
9. Upload the zipped solution for submission.
